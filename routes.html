                            The special talents of the area are marine mammal encounters. Whales, fur seals and dolphins
                            live permanently in the coastal waters. Whale watching trips leave the town several times a
                            day and the local seal colony is always entertaining.

                            Kaikōura Canyon, where many wildlife encounters take place, is deep and open and the sea
                            conditions can change quickly. When the seas are too rough, head to the clouds and whale
                            watch from above with Wings over Whales.

                        The "Central Otago Touring Route" is a travel route through the Central
                        Otago region of New Zealand's South Island. From Queenstown to
                        Alexandra, travellers can explore the region's beautiful lakes and
                        mountains, local vineyards and wineries, and charming towns such as
                        Arrowtown. In addition, there are opportunities to enjoy outdoor activities
                        such as hiking, cycling and golf. The region is famous for its production of
                        world-class wines, especially Pinot Noir. The Central Otago Touring Route
                        offers an unforgettable experience for nature, culture and food lovers.

                            You’ll begin this road trip in Ōtepoti Dunedin, Otago’s principal city. More than any other
                            New Zealand city, Dunedin’s history charts the highs and lows of the early pioneers.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This history is evident in the city’s heritage architecture. Prime examples are St Paul’s
                            Cathedral, Dunedin Railway Station, and the Dunedin Courthouse. To learn more, take the Old
                            Town Walk tour.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you’re interested in the region’s Māori and European history, visit Toitū Otago Settlers
                            Museum and Otago Museum. Highlights for the latter, which is also the only world’s only
                            bicultural science centre, include a replica Māori coastal village and articulated Moa
                            skeletons.

                        <p>
                            The next morning, explore the historic town of St Bathans. With just one street and only ten
                            permanent residents, St Bathans is best known for its unofficial residents, who are, well,
                            ghosts.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The town also has a beautiful turquoise lake, notable for both its origin and its colour. In
                            the 1930s, miners flattened Kildare Hill, which was originally 120 metres, to create a deep
                            mine shaft. When the sides of the shaft began to encroach on the town, it was abandoned and
                            left to fill with water, which mixed with the minerals in the rock to create a vivid emerald
                            lake.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the early afternoon, you'll arrive in Clyde, one of the region's most picturesque
                            villages, where you'll spend the night. At the height of the gold rush, Clyde was the most
                            populous town in New Zealand, a fact that has left its mark on the town's architecture.

                            There's a reason why this part of New Zealand has received so much praise for its wine. The
                            combination of warm, cool climate, glacier-fed soils and some clever winemakers make Central
                            Otago one of the best wine regions in the world.

                        <p>
                            Part of the joy of this road trip is the isolation. The journey through these vast, empty
                            landscapes gives you the opportunity to relax and feel anything but alone.

                            If you like mining-era heritage buildings, Cromwell, your overnight home, certainly has its
                            share of fine examples, such as London House Stables, Captain Barry's Cottage, McNulty
                            House.... but it is the more recent history of these buildings that sets them apart.

                            Start the day with a visit to Arrowtown. Apart from the picturesque historic buildings and
                            alpine views, this historic mining town is worth a visit for its restaurants and cafes
                            alone. In this respect, this small town is no slouch and attracts some of New Zealand's best
                            chefs.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you're looking for action, take a motorboat trip down the Dart River to the UNESCO World
                            Heritage-listed Mount Aspiring National Park with Dart River Adventures. Much of the thrill
                            of this trip comes from the ever-present risk of running aground.

                        <p>
                            Once ashore, make your way to Queenstown, the last stop on the tour. Although the road trip
                            ends here, it doesn't have to. Queenstown has plenty to offer, including spectacular
                            scenery, a thriving food scene and more than 200 adrenaline-fuelled activities, enough to
                            keep you entertained for a long time.
