                New Zealand, a land of natural beauty and rich history. The Maori arrived
                over 1,000 years ago, establishing a unique culture. Then Europeans
                arrived in the 17th century, triggering conflict and tension over control of
                the land. In the 19th century, the Land War broke out. In the late 20th
                century, Maori began a cultural renaissance. New Zealand became an
                independent nation in 1907 and gained women's suffrage in 1893. Today,
                it is known for its stunning scenery, vibrant Maori culture and
                commitment to environmental conservation. A history of cultural
                encounters, struggles and resilience that has shaped New Zealand's
                identity

                <p>
                    Discover New Zealand's fascinating Maori history, full of intrigue and
                    resilience. More than 1,000 years ago, the Maori arrived here in canoes
                    from the Pacific Islands, establishing a unique culture. With the arrival of
                    Europeans in the 17th century, conflicts and tensions over control of the
                    land erupted, culminating in the Land War in the 19th century. However,
                    in the late 20th century, Maori began a cultural renaissance, fighting for
                    their rights and revitalising their language and traditions. New Zealand's
                    Maori history is a testament to the resilience and determination of a
                    people who have left an indelible mark on the country's identity and
                    culture.

                    Discover New Zealand's incredible wildlife with three animal highlights.
                    The kiwi, a nocturnal, flightless bird with a long curved beak, is known for
                    its quiet demeanour and ability to sniff out food underground. The kakapo,
                    a nocturnal parrot and the world's heaviest parrot, is flightless and
                    surprisingly flies in its sleep. The tuatara, a prehistoric reptile, is found only
                    in New Zealand and can live more than 100 years. With its unique
                    appearance and a transparent third "skin" over its eyes, the tuatara is a true
                    treasure. These iconic animals represent the diversity and beauty of New
                    Zealand's wildlife.

                    specimens. The kauri, a monumental tree endemic to the north of the
                    country, can reach heights of over 50 metres and live for over 1,000 years.
                    Flax, known as harakeke in Maori, is a versatile plant that has been used for
                    centuries by Maori to make baskets, clothing and rope. The pohutukawa,
                    also known as the New Zealand Christmas tree, is noted for its vibrant red
                    flowers that bloom during the summer. This tree is a symbol of New
                    Zealand's culture and natural beauty. These three specimens represent
